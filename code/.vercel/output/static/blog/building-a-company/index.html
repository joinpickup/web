        <p>In May 2022 I was in Salt Lake City on a climbing trip, busy wrestling boulders and getting scared on cliffsides. After two years of intermittently hearing about the idea of Pickup, Andrew told me he was getting serious about development and asked if I would take on organizational and finance roles. After less convincing that I maybe should have needed, I agreed to be my best friend’s COO.</p>
<p>Together with Andrew’s mom, Stefanie, we started to sort out how exactly this was going to work. It took time for Andrew to catch me up to speed on the details of what he’s been up to with the project and determine what we needed to do first now that we were formally a team. Without any formal education or experience managing teams, the early stages were scattered to say the least. It took several weeks to really get off the ground, but once we were going, we managed to get into the groove of it. All together, the start of Pickup LLC was unconventional — and awesome.</p>
<p>In our first steps we spent a lot of time talking about product ideas and deciding what was best to implement. This was fun, I thought, as I got to share in my friend’s passion project. Then, Andrew added me to his Notion workspace where he was keeping track of all of the work so far; this was a wake up call to the exact role that I had in the company: organization as Andrew’s second brain. I will give him credit to having kept a space for each of the key ideas, but it was clear that a lot of work needed to be done to really hone in on our focus, and to design a workOS to match. I helped Andrew revamp the Notion and we used it for some time before falling to the taunt of industry software and switching to Atlassian products. Jira helped us stay on task just fine, but over time we felt limited by what we could do; our team felt too small for the size that Jira and Confluence are scaled to. So back to Notion we went, and we completely re-worked our Workspace to give us exactly what we needed. Six months after starting, organization was finally feeling good.</p>
<p>Six months is admittedly a long time to focus on organization alone, but fortunately we made good progress on other key facets of our company in that time. Andrew, Stefanie and I wanted to make sure that we built a company that reflected our values and beliefs. Admittedly, we also needed to do quite a bit of our own research learning how to operate a business. It was well worth it to spend this much time working on the tedious behind-the-scenes parts. Primarily because, now as we get closer and closer to a deliverable product, we know that we are better prepared for it, and that our values of empowering individuals, people over profit and life-long learning are etched in all along the way.</p>
<p>With a solid foundation we now arrive at the present, where our focus is on coding the alpha version and seeking out investor funding. The best part about the day-to-day now is that we have the infrastructure to set up our direction and then just start working. Put another way, I borrow this phrase which I first learned from a high school mentor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plan your work, work your plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When working with any team (and in particular with a partner who has more ideas than he can keep in his head at one time), I’ve found it so much easier to first plan out what needs to get done in a certain time frame; for example, lay out the goals for a project before starting and then outline the tasks needed to get it done. Once planned, each week we can look at the tasks in front of us and prioritize as necessary. It’s a method that works well for us, and we would recommend it for any team.</p>
<p>Pickup is an idea we are passionate about and will continue working hard on. With a strong personal and now company base we’re excited about the next steps of our product. Early next year we hope to have a web-app available in its alpha stage, with a beta to come in the spring and full release in time for summer 2023. Thanks for reading about our company history; we hope you’ll keep up to date with our product development as we work closer to building a product we believe in.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Brian</p>
