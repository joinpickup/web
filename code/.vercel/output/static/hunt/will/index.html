    I, Alistair Drake, journalist and resident of the City of New Haven, State
    of Connecticut being of sound mind, not under duress or undue influence, and
    with full understanding of the nature and extent of all my property and this
    disposition thereof, hereby make, publish, and declare this document to be
    my Last Will and Testament and revoke any and all prior wills and codicils
    that I may have made.
    <br>
    <br>

    To begin, I forgive any and all outstanding debts owed to me.

    <br>
    <br>
    To the New Haven Historical Society I leave the following: - My property on Elm
    Street - Old maps of New Haven from the early 1700s - Various records from the
    early 1900s and a vintage record player

    <br>
    <br>
    To the Connecticut Museum Of Culture and History I leave the following: - Cufflinks
    from the confederacy during the Civil War - A Union army belt buckle
    <br>
    <br>

    To the New Haven Public Library I leave all of my books amongst which
    include; - The Agony And Ecstasy, Irving Stone - A Farewell To Arms, Ernest
    Hemmingway - The Three Musketeers, Alexander Dumas - East of Eden, John
    Steinbeck - Red Badge of Courage, Stephen Crane
    <br>
    <br>

    Having no family or relatives or any beneficiaries of note, I leave anything
    not mentioned above to the New Haven Historical Society of whom will decide
    how to accommodate my assets.
    <br>
    <br>

    Ive lived a long life. A sufficient life. Seen and heard more than most. I
    hope that what outlives me isnt my name but rather the pieces I've put
    together and the songs that they've sung.

    <br>
    <br>
    In these times of duress and disconnect, I find solace in the stories that connect
    us and the words that bind us. Lessons from the past set by authors, poets and
    artists alike.

    <br>
    <br>
    Though I am no longer alive, I, like the storytellers I admire, hope to have
    wisdom to impart.

    <br>
    <br>
    There is value in admiration. The principal philosophy of art, music, and literature
    is that of creative inspiration. That holding true, however, without a fundamental
    trust in one's mission, those guidelines can quickly turn to jealousy, eating
    away at one's sense of self.
    <br>
    <br>

    What I've learned and hope to share is that when hearing the stories told of
    the past, make sure to find the place that centers envy and faith.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Signed,
    <br>
    <br>

    A. Drake
