    I, Alistair Drake, librarian and resident of the City of New Haven, State of
    Connecticut being of sound mind, not under duress or undue influence, and
    with full understanding of the nature and extent of all my property and this
    disposition thereof, hereby make, publish, and declare this document to be
    my Last Will and Testament and revoke any and all prior wills and codicils
    that I may have made.

    <br>

    I achieved what most would consider a successful life. I had money, I had
    influence and I had freedom. These material gifts were lucky. Very early on,
    I had every opportunity given to me. Like a young Dantes, by all accounts I
    had a perfect life.

    <br>
    <br>

    This, however, is not the legacy I want to be remembered by. Like the Count
    of Monte Christo, I hope to leave my mark with a hunt. A series of clues,
    with increasing difficulty. I want to see if the people who outlive me can
    outsmart me.

    <br>
    <br>

    My arbitor is privy to the details of the hunt and should be able to answer
    any and all questions. Call him at 204510069 with quesitons.

    In my later years, I spent my time working at the library. Being surrounded
    by books and words, I found solace in the stories that connect us and the
    words that bind us. Lessons from the past set by authors, poets and artists
    alike.

    <br>
    <br>
    Though I am no longer alive, I, like the storytellers I admire, hope to have
    wisdom to impart.

    <br>
    <br>
    There is value in admiration. The principal philosophy of art, music, and literature
    is that of creative inspiration. That holding true, however, without a fundamental
    trust in one's mission, those guidelines can quickly turn to jealousy, eating
    away at one's sense of self.
    <br>
    <br>

    What I've learned and hope to share is that when hearing the stories told of
    the past, make sure to find the place that centers envy and faith.
    <br>
    <br>

    With that, you have all you need. I bid you farewell, in body and in mind,
    hopefully, this hunt will keep my legacy alive.

    <br>
    <br>

    Signed,
    <br>
    <br>

    A. Drake
