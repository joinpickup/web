I, Alistair Drake, journalist and resident of the City of New Haven, State of Connecticut being of sound mind, not under duress or undue influence, and with full understanding of the nature and extent of all my property and this disposition thereof, hereby make, publish, and declare this document to be my Last Will and Testament and revoke any and all prior wills and codicils that I may have made.

To begin, I forgive any and all outstanding debts owed to me.

To the New Haven Historical Society I leave the following:

- My property on Elm Street
- Old maps of New Haven from the early 1700s
- Various records from the early 1900s and a vintage record player

To the Connecticut Museum Of Culture and History I leave the following:

- Cufflinks from the confederacy during the Civil War
- A Union army belt buckle

To the New Haven Public Library I leave all of my books amongst which include;

- The Agony And Ecstasy, Irving Stone
- A Farewell To Arms, Ernest Hemmingway
- The Three Musketeers, Alexander Dumas
- East of Eden, John Steinbeck
- Red Badge of Courage, Stephen Crane

Having no family or relatives or any beneficiaries of note, I leave anything not mentioned above to the New Haven Historical Society of whom will decide how to accommodate my assets.

I’ve lived a long life. A sufficient life. Seen and heard more than most. I hope that what outlives me isn’t my name but rather the pieces I've put together and the songs that they've sung.

In these times of duress and disconnect, I find solace in the stories that connect us and the words that bind us. Lessons from the past set by authors, poets and artists alike.

Though I am no longer alive, I, like the storytellers I admire, hope to have wisdom to impart.

There is value in admiration. The principal philosophy of art, music, and literature is that of creative inspiration. That holding true, however, without a fundamental trust in one's mission, those guidelines can quickly turn to jealousy, eating away at one's sense of self.

What I've learned and hope to share is that when hearing the stories told of the past, make sure to find the place that centers envy and faith.

Signed,

A. Drake
